## Fill in the details for your cohort.
It is required to provide:

- a cohort name of your choice
- the contract address of your Moloch DAO **not the treasury address**
- a link to the hosted image asset for the soulbound ERC-721 you are issuing
- the ticker symbol for your SBT
- the name of your SBT

## Adjust the cohort duration and stake amount.

For the cohort to fit your needs as onboarding party, you will have to adjust the variables below and select a staking asset. In detail, you have to set:

- the onboarding duration, i.e. for how many days after deployment you want cohort members to be able to stake
- the cohort duration, or how long cohort members have time to complete the tasks that lead to DAO membership
- the required stake amount in WEI or in asset units
- the contract address of your staking asset
- the treasury address of your DAO, where the funds should be forwarded to
- a maximum for cohort members to stake
- required shares in your DAO for cohort members to reclaim their stake

## Set permissions for your cohort
As we are working on DAOs as teams, you can add up to two additional administrators, who can slash members. Furthermore, you can make your cohort a shaman of your v.3 Moloch DAO for re-using your cohort and automating the onboarding process. Lastly, you can import an existing TOP HAT of your DAO to integrate ROM into your custom identity management setup.

## Review the details of the cohort you want to deploy.

## When deploying the cohort, you will have to sign the transactions. Now, you trigger a DAO proposal at your DAOHaus v.3 Moloch DAO.

## The proposal that is being triggered and has to be voted on by your DAO, will look something like this.

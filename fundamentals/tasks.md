# Preventing Slashing

**How to prevent slashing**

**First**, you joined the cohort for a reason, so participate and contribute in order to learn all that RaidGuild has to offer. Cohort-specific team projects will be your starting point for participation.

**Second**, be brave. Work with willing RaidGuild members to help them on projects they present. Come up with new ideas for RaidGuild. Offer your services and contribute proactively where you can.

**Finally**, your initiation as a RaidGuild member will require an existing member to invite you. At this point, you will have the ability to reclaim your staked tokens.

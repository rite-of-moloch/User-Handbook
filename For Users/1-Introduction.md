# Introducing Rite of Moloch or ROM

Rite of Moloch is no HR for DAOs, because we detest that human beings are reduced to a resource in the corporate world. Yet, we want to make sure our community stay healthy and deal with work and members prudently.

Rite of Moloch (RoM) brings transparent, accountable, and data driven onboarding to DAOs. Rite of Moloch allows DAOs to name administrators, who own onboarding processes. By using RoM, DAOs can make informed decisions when designing their onboarding processes and improve them by accessing performance data on RoM. 

Community members then are held accountable to their output by staking a bond on Rite of Moloch. As a result, RoM removes the burden of responsibility of the commons from DAOs and enables prudent delegation of responsibility. On a technical level we enable this innovation by using Hats protocol in combination with DAOHaus V3 Shamans to built on resilient Web3 infrastructure.

As a new member joining a cohort you'll be required to add some skin in the game by staking a token to join the cohort.

## Stake to Initiate and show having skin in the game

### Why?

DAOs invest time and resources into cohort programs with the hopes of onboarding new members. Rite of Moloch both encourages serious participation and concentrates DAO resources on effective contributors. Staking tokens also allows initiates to show they are serious about joining RaidGuild.

### What is at stake?

The stake is used to claim the cohort SBT and solidify accountability to the group. Should the initiate fail to participate in the cohort or drop out, that stake is at risk of being slashed and moved to the RaidGuild treasury.

This can only happen after the expiration time has passed.

### Soul Bound Token (SBT)

Upon successfully staking the required tokens, the initiate will receive one Soul Bound Token. This token validates that they have staked the required tokens in order to participate in the current or upcoming cohort season and is non-transferable.

This token will be used to grant access within the [discord](https://discord.gg/raidguild) to the cohort-specific channels.

What is a Soul Bound Token (SBT)?

* NFT where the transfer functions have been overwritten so they revert
* Once minted, an SBT cannot be transferred to a different address.
* Stake to join a cohort and receive SBT token
  * SBT is an on-chain achievement for joining the cohort
  * NFT functions as an access pass to token gated discord and resources


### How to Stake and Receive a SBT

1. Go to [rom.wtf](https://rom.wtf)
2. Select **Connect** to connect your wallet. Confirm you are on the Gnosis blockchain
3. Confirm the asset and amount required to stake
4. Select **Approve** and sign the transaction to allow staking the required amount.
5. Select **Stake** and sign the transaction to stake your tokens. A confirmation will show with SBT token and expiration timer
6. May the force be with you


You can bridge DAI from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain using the [Gnosis Bridge](https://bridge.gnosischain.com/) and then swap to your token of choice using [Honeyswap](https://honeyswap.org/).

## Expiration Timer
When you join a cohort through the staking process, a timer starts. When it expires, your staked tokens can be slashed.

### Why is there a timer?

After you stake to be initiated into the cohort and receive your SBT, you will have a designated time to be initiated as a RaidGuild member.

The allotted time is recorded on-chain in the Rite Of Moloch contract.

When the timer expires the RaidGuild can choose to slash your cohort membership forfeiting your stake.

Slay or be slain.

## Sponsor Initiate

The Rite of Moloch allows anyone to sponsor an initiate to the cohort, effectively providing a grant for the participant.  This enables participants with low or restricted financial resources the ability to join the cohort.  If the sponsored contributor successfully joins the DAO - they are able to claim the tokens and get paid!

### How to Sponsor

1. Connect your wallet to the [Rite of Moloch dApp](https://rom.wtf)
2. Check of "Sponsor an initiate"
3. Add the initiate's wallet address
4. Approve require staking amount

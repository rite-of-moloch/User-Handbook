## Join a Cohort

### What is a RaidGuild cohort?

The cohort program allows groups of new initiates to participate in a series of onboarding sessions called a season. Cohort members will learn what RaidGuild entails, projects the guild is currently working on, and prepare to participate in raids.


You must be invited to join RaidGuild by a current member.

### What happens during the cohort season?

A combination of synchronous and asynchronous activity will occur for 3-4 weeks. Each season may vary as we evolve and improve, but they typically include:

* Information sessions
* Cohort member introductions
* Team building
* Role Identification
* Cohort Raid formation
* Completion of a cohort team project

## Preventing Slashing

### How to prevent slashing**

**First**, you joined the cohort for a reason, so participate and contribute in order to learn all that RaidGuild has to offer. Cohort-specific team projects will be your starting point for participation.

**Second**, be brave. Work with willing RaidGuild members to help them on projects they present. Come up with new ideas for RaidGuild. Offer your services and contribute proactively where you can.

**Finally**, your initiation as a RaidGuild member will require an existing member to invite you. At this point, you will have the ability to reclaim your staked tokens.

## Claim Stake

Should you be granted RaidGuild membership then you will be allowed to claim your stake back from the cohort.

#### After having submitted you transaction through Metamask, you should see the application approving the asset.

![8 4_ROM_cohort_member_approving_stake](https://github.com/rite-of-moloch/User-Handbook/assets/104435781/2ba4bdc0-6742-4b05-bd33-47c71f0febaf)

#### As soon as the asset amount was approved you can stake yourself and sponsor another intitiate.

##### For staking yourself, click 'stake' without ticking the box for sponsoring an initiate.
When clicking 'stake' a Metamask prompt should open to sign the transaction. After you have checked the values for accuracy, you can sign the interaction. The application then indicates that your command is processed by 'staking'. After the staking process is complete, you can check your wallet for the received token.

##### Sponsoring an initiate.

If you are a mentor, or friend and want to ensure that someone else gets the opportunity to participate in a cohort, you can sponsor their address. For this you check the box for sponsoring an initiate, insert their wallet address, and proceed to 'STAKE'.

**Beware that by staking an initiate, you are not automatically staked too. You are advised to complete your staking process first, before sponsoring an initiate. This does not apply, however, for cases where you do not want to personally participate.**

### Successfully staked - you are an active cohort member now.

### To reclaim your stake you will have to become a DAO member within the specified amount of time.

#### If you do not succeed, your stake will be forwarded to the treasury of the DAO you wanted membership in.

DAOs commit resources towards onboarding new members (cohorts), while cohort participants often have little to no skin in the game. This can lead to wasteful outcomes, in terms of DAO resources and onboarding success rates.

This tool has been designed for DAOs to require new cohort members to stake certain assets. The cohort receives a soul bound token (non-transferable token tied to that member), after staking, and this token is used to provide gated access to the cohort and resources.

The staked assets are then forfeited if the user doesn’t complete the onboarding process. The individual cohort contracts are not upgradeable, but the cohort clone factory contract enables additional implementations to be added.

Currently the cohorts are specifically designed for Moloch DAOs and DAOHaus, but we can easily add new implementations for staking NFTs, or different membership criteria.

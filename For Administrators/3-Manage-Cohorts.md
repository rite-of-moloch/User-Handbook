# Manage Cohorts
As a community or project manager in Web3 you probably will not manage just one cohort, but multiple. Rite of Moloch embeds your work in an intsitutional framework that uses [HATs](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz) and [DAOHaus v.3](https://daohaus.club) to back you with governance and permissions for carrying out your work.

This way, you can track individual members, monitor cohort health and slash when individuals misbehave or threaten the reputation of the DAO. Web3 is fast paced, so you may want to get someone on board to take over where needed. Adding administrators under the 'admin' section enables you to get help.

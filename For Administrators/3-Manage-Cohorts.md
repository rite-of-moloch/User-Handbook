# Manage Cohorts
As a community or project manager in Web3 you probably will not manage just one cohort, but multiple. Rite of Moloch embeds your work in an intsitutional framework that uses [HATs](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz) and [DAOHaus v.3](https://daohaus.club) to back you with governance and permissions for carrying out your work.

This way, you can track individual members, monitor cohort health and slash when individuals misbehave or threaten the reputation of the DAO. Web3 is fast paced, so you may want to get someone on board to take over where needed. Adding administrators under the 'admin' section enables you to get help.

## 1.1 View and search all cohorts in the list of cohorts

## 1.2 Select the cohort you are managing to view members, who have staked. 

In the beginning your cohort will look something like this.

As soon as you have promoted staking or published the bounty, for which you require participants to deposit a bond, you cohort will start to look more like this.

## 1.3 Notice when cohort members start delivering and claiming their stake.

Shares will go to zero for members who either have been slashed or claimed back their stake. To get a more detailed view on the status and health of your cohort, visit the metrics dashboard.

In detail, a claimed or slashed member looks like this.

## 1.4 Slashing members manually should be the last resort.

Sometimes it does not work out from the beginning, or someone repeatedly violated your community rules. You should have the authority to take action and remove the individual from the cohort swiftly. Since cohorts are situation specific and do not overlap with the DAO, you can take this action as an administrator after the onboarding period lapsed.

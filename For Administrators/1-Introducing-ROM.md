### Since you are (becoming) a cohort administrator, choose cohort administration.

We have decided to have everything transparent, because everything is on-chain anyway. To give non-technical users a chance to look behind the curtains too, we wanted to make the dApp as open as possible.

### Navigate the administrator features.

Through the admin menu you can deploy cohorts, manage existing cohorts, browse and manage all members who have interacted with the staking functionality, and revisit metrics for quick decision making and inteligence through a customised dashboard.
